  <h3>Why does the app need my location?</h3>
  <p>
    UV Butterfly uses your precise location ONLY when you grant permission to fetch accurate, local UV index data for personalized recommendations. You can also manually enter your city.
  </p>

  <h3>The UV index seems incorrect</h3>
  <p>
    UV data comes from reliable meteorological sources but may vary depending on local conditions and time of day. For critical sun protection decisions, use the app as a guide and follow local weather reports.
  </p>

  <h3>How accurate are the sun protection recommendations?</h3>
  <p>
    Recommendations are based on established scientific guidelines for UV protection. However, individual skin sensitivity may vary. When in doubt, always err on the side of caution and consult professionals for specific health concerns.
